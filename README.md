## Project Description
Project BLUE Book is a website where customers can look for events within any major city in the world and find a restaurant near the event venue/area.

## User Story
As a customer\
I want to select a city to search then select an event or venue\
so that I can select a restaurant/bar that will be within a 5 mile radius to the event venue.\ 
Given so many choices of things to do we help the user narrow down their options of restaurants/bars near an event.\
When a city is named and submited, a list of event venues/areas will be displayed.\
Then you will select your venue and then select a restaurant within 5 miles of the venue. The restaurant list will include address, cuisine, and estimated cost.
